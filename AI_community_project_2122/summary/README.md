# Review Summerization 

The model is trained on food reviews with  datapoints.</br>

## Prerequisites

1.Pandas</br>
2.NumPy</br>
3.NLTK(natural language tool kit)</br>
4.scipy</br>
5.Flask (API)</br>
## Project Structure

Text_Summerization.ipynb - This is the file where we trained the model and stored the weights.</br>

app.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives text data through GUI or API calls, summerizes the text and outputs it.</br>

## Running the project ()

Project Description-</br>
-->As the project title suggests, Text Summarization is an application which helps in summarizing the text.
--> We can upload our data and this application gives us the summary of that data in as many numbers of lines as we want.</br>
 
Components Included.</br>
1.NLTK: Nltk is natural language toolkit library. It is a platform for building Python programs to work with human languages.</br> 
  ->It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.</br> 
  ->In text summarizer, this library is used to remove stop words in English vocabulary and to convert these words to root forms.</br>

## Applications:

1.People need to learn much from texts. But they tend to want to spend less time while doing this. </br>
2.It aims to solve this problem by supplying them the summaries of the text from which they want to gain information.</br>
3.Goals of this project are that these summaries will be as important as possible in the aspect of the textsâ€™ intention.</br>
4.The user will be eligible to select the summary length.</br>
5.Supplying the user, a smooth and clear interface.</br>
6.Configuring a fast replying server system.</br>
